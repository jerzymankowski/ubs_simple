# ubs_simple

To run the exercise you need some kind of server(nginx, tomcat, apache) as it requests the data.json, and as I remember since 2017 you cant run such projects that are request file with file:/// protocol on chrome without the use of a plugin

Why no webpack or gulp, ts or jsx, precss or scss bem

Cause the project has no future use for me;
Since it's just an exercise I decided to not to use any kind of boilerplate;
The configuration itself would use up to half or more the required time to produce that amount of code and complexity and as it stands right now, time is the most precious thing, as you can't turn it back
